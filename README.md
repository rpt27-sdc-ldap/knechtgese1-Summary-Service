# Overview: Audible Publishers Summary
This is an mock-up audible item page built during the Hack Reactor immersive's Front End Capstone project. This project is designed to maintain all original functionality and mimic the style of audible item page. This component of the project - Publisher's Summary Service - displayes the publisher's summary and copyright information for a given book.

## My contributions
Designed and built the Publisher's Review Service.
Coordinated and deployed entire team’s modules on proxy server in AWS EC2 instance.
Utilized agile workflow practices on a 4 -person remote team.

## Requirements
An `nvmrc` file is included if using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
Node 6.13.0.

## Development
The database folder includes two helper functions which generates random data and populates the generated data into the database. The first helper function which generates random data and save the generated data into the database is located in database/populateData.js file. The mongo db setup file which specifies the database schema is located in database/index.js file

The App componet which includes RenderDom is located in client/src/index.js file. Using the following url `http://localhost:1220/api/summary/${bookId}` the app component fetches publisher's summary and copyright information for a given book from the server to be rendered.

The server with two endpoints are located in server/index.js. The first endpoint is `/api/summary/:bookId` This takes a random book id and returns an object with the following data {id: Number, summary: String, short_summary: String, copyright: String}.

The second endpont`http://localhost:1220/api/summaries/:bookIds` will accept array of book ids and returns an array of objects with the following data for each of the book ids {id: Number, summary: String, short_summary: String, copyright: String}

### Usage
